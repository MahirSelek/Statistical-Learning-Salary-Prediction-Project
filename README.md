# Statistical Learning Salary Prediction Project
 
## NBA Players Salary Prediction

**Aim of the project:**

As it is known, the NBA is one of today's biggest sports organizations, even one of the most popular. It is a huge organization that is regularly followed by so many people around the world every year, and beyond that it is a huge monetary market.
As two sports enthusiast students, we decided to make a project about basketball players playing in this popular league. We wanted to do a forecasting project because it is a big league in terms of money and because the income wages of the players arouse curiosity every year. At the same time, this project should have been linked to the content of our course. That's why we decided it was appropriate for this project to do a regression project on players' statistics and income salaries.
